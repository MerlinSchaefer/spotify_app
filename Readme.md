# Spotify_app

This repository contains the code for my Spotify project.
I created two scripts that fullfill the main goals of the project. *Other goals may be added*

The project will be updated from time to time as I intend to use and improve the python scripts over time. They will however always solve the same issues.

## DUO.py
The first part of the project is the creation of a better Duos Playlist for me and my girlfriend by using our data through the Spotify API.
We were not satisfied with the Duos Playlist Spotify provided through our Spotify Duo Subscription. The artists seemed to be "correct" but the songs were not. 
It hardly offered any songs we actually both listened to and felt more like a wild guessing game based on our taste than an actual combination of shared favorites and good recommendations.
Which is why I created a python script that creates a playlist that does just that. DUO.py
So far we are satiesfied with the results, and any ideas for improvement will be implemented soon.

## PlaylistBuddy
The spotify recommendations below each playlist are a nice feature, but depending on the playlist the sometimes feel a little unrefined.
I therefore took the liberty to try to define them. The PlaylistBuddy will add 1-20 new songs to your playlist, based on spotifies recommendations and their similarity to the
existing songs in a given playlist.
